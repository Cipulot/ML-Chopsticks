# ML_Chopsticks
Solution to gather user behavior information when using chopsticks and compile a set of usage statistics based on a ML generated model.

## Inspiration
Following a gimmick that popped up at the end of last [CWF](https://scottkwang.github.io/CodeWithFriends-Spring2020/) edition the project involves chopsticks. The pitch was to create a "5G enabled" chopstick but I then realized that it was a bit impractical (at least for now). Putting the 5G part of the idea aside, this project will enable the user, thanks to ML based models, to gather information about his/her usage behaviour and all sorts of statistics of use.
